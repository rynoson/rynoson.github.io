        <div style="display: flex; width:100vw; column-gap: 100px; margin-left: 50px; align-items: center;">
            <div>Based on my own media consumption and what my classmates consume, I found the three I shared the most similarity to were
            <a class="link" href="https://react-7a466.web.app/">Andrew</a>,<a class="link"
                href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/csce-445/home"> Erika</a>, and <a class="link"
                href="http://people.tamu.edu/~neha2003/CSCE445.html"> Neha.</a>
                <br></br>
                Like Andrew, Twitter and Reddit were the social medias that we both consumed the most. These two social medias are most like the idea of a "human-RSS feed", since much of what I see on Reddit or Twitter are things I purposely subscribe to due to my own interest.
                <br></br>
                Similar to Erika, video games is also where we share heavy similarity, specifically in regards to first-person shooters and strategy/puzzle games. Video games draw parallels to traditional stories because of how unlimited the genre classifications tend to be, and
                as of late there has been a shift in the gaming industry towards story-driven games over raw entertainment games like shoot-em-ups. Video games can offer an exciting way to tell narrativesâ€” or not if you also play Valorant and Teamfight Tactics. 
                <br></br>Also like Neha, the types of music we listen to are very similar. Korean pop is definitely prominent between the both of us as well as a bit of American pop, but I definitely lean more into rap/R&B in my own listening. I think like video games and movies, music has a wide net of genres to cast over.
                Though, it also tends to be a polarizing medium, because there are plenty of times where I wasn't handed the aux cord because of what I listen to.
                <br></br>
                If I were to re-organize my media usage, I think it would be better to dive deeper into the specific categories rather than broadly list all of them. Of what I consume, being video games and music, I would definitely love to display how much I consume 
                of each in some sort of breakdown, like an explanation as to why and what it does for me. There isn't really any point to display the device type because surprisingly a lot of media is device-agnostic (video games too as of late), so it's matter of just what's convenient.
